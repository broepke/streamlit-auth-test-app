[Streamlit Authenticator](https://github.com/mkhorasani/Streamlit-Authenticator) is an amazing took written by Mohammad Khorasani
(mkhorasani on GitHub) that helps you mange a simple but powerful user management system for a Streamlit app.  One of the things that wasn't completely clear is how to manage Multi Page apps with proper session behavior.  Befor porting may apps over, I decided to write a clean example.
